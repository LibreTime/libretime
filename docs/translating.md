LibreTime is translatable software and it depends on it's users to help translating it.

The LibreTime translation efforts are hosted on [zanata.org](https://zanata.org) in
the [LibreTime project](https://translate.zanata.org/project/view/libretime/).

Like the development of the software itself, the translation efforts are lead by
the community.

If you would like to assist in translating LibreTime you need to register an account
that works with zanata. Information on the options available may be found on the
[zanata instance](https://translate.zanata.org) we are using.

The email address you used for your zanata account will be used to attribute your
work in the resulting gettext files. So choose one your comfortable with being 
published on GitHub.

Getting strings into LibreTime is still a manual process at this point (automation is planned). 
[Let us know](https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime/issues/new) in an issue if you need us to
push new strings to zanata or pull translations into the git.
